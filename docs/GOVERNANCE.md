# Content Production Governance

## Purpose and Scope
This governance policy defines mandatory controls for planning, creating, reviewing, and publishing Instagram content. It applies to all team members, contractors, and automation workflows involved in account operations.

## 1) Instagram Policy Constraints and Prohibited Behaviors
All content and account actions must comply with Instagram Terms of Use, Community Guidelines, and applicable local law.

### Prohibited behaviors
- Posting illegal, violent, hateful, harassing, sexually exploitative, or self-harm-promoting content.
- Coordinated inauthentic behavior (fake engagement, bot amplification, spam comment/reply loops).
- Impersonation, deceptive identity signals, or misleading profile/post claims.
- Use of unauthorized automation that violates platform rules (e.g., artificial likes/follows/comments, scraping personal data without authorization).
- Posting misinformation likely to cause harm, including fabricated health, safety, civic, or financial claims.
- Publishing content that infringes third-party rights (copyright, trademark, publicity/privacy rights).

### Operational constraints
- Do not publish without traceable source references for factual claims.
- Do not reuse user-generated content without explicit permission and attribution where required.
- Do not target prohibited audiences or protected classes with discriminatory messaging.
- Maintain audit logs for content generation, edits, approvals, and publication timestamps.

## 2) Human-Review Gates (Required)
Automation may draft, but human reviewers are accountable for publication decisions.

### Early-phase mandatory gates
- **Phase 0 (Pilot / New campaign):** 100% manual review and explicit sign-off by Content Lead and Compliance Reviewer before posting.
- **Phase 1 (Stabilization):** 100% manual review for high-risk categories (health, finance, legal, minors, crisis events); sampled review for low-risk categories only after four consecutive weeks of zero critical incidents.
- **Phase 2 (Mature operations):** Risk-based review routing is allowed, but any sponsored/affiliate or policy-sensitive content remains mandatory manual approval.

### Minimum approvals before publish
- Content quality/editorial approval.
- Brand safety and policy compliance approval.
- Rights/licensing confirmation for all media assets.

No post may be published until all required approvals are recorded in the pre-publish checklist.

## 3) Brand Safety Filters
Every post must pass automated and manual brand-safety checks.

### Safety categories and enforcement
- **Hate and abuse:** Block content containing slurs, dehumanizing statements, or attacks against protected classes.
- **Medical/legal claims:**
  - Prohibit diagnosis/treatment guarantees, legal outcome guarantees, and unsubstantiated efficacy statements.
  - Require evidence and disclaimers where informational content references medical, legal, or financial topics.
- **Copyrighted assets:**
  - Verify license ownership or permission for music, footage, photos, templates, logos, and creator content.
  - Block publication if provenance is unclear or if usage rights are time/region restricted beyond intended distribution.

### Escalation triggers
Escalate to Compliance and Legal reviewers when content includes:
- Potentially regulated claims.
- Third-party likeness/voice reproduction.
- News/event content with uncertain factual basis.

## 4) Disclosure and Monetization Rules
Transparency is mandatory for paid relationships and monetized recommendations.

### Sponsored content
- Clearly disclose paid partnerships using platform-native paid partnership tools where available.
- Include clear and conspicuous disclosure text (e.g., `#ad`, `Paid partnership with ...`) in captions and on-screen overlays when needed.
- Do not bury disclosures behind truncation or unrelated hashtags.

### Affiliate content
- Disclose affiliate relationships in each relevant post/story/reel.
- Ensure claims about products are truthful, substantiated, and not misleading.
- Maintain records of affiliate links, campaign owners, and claim substantiation references.

### Prohibited monetization conduct
- Hidden sponsorships or ambiguous disclosures.
- Incentivized testimonials presented as organic user opinions without disclosure.
- Performance claims that imply guaranteed outcomes.

## 5) Incident Handling and Rollback Procedures
An incident is any post that violates policy, creates legal/brand risk, or materially underperforms against agreed thresholds.

### Severity levels
- **SEV-1 (Critical):** Clear policy/legal violation, safety risk, or significant reputational harm.
- **SEV-2 (High):** Likely violation or high-risk ambiguity requiring urgent correction.
- **SEV-3 (Moderate):** Underperformance or quality issue without direct policy breach.

### Response SLAs
- **SEV-1:** Immediate takedown/pause, notify Compliance + Leadership within 30 minutes.
- **SEV-2:** Pause promotion, investigate within 4 hours, decision within 24 hours.
- **SEV-3:** Review in next business cycle, document learnings and optimization actions.

### Rollback playbook
1. **Containment:** Unpublish/remove content or disable paid distribution.
2. **Preservation:** Snapshot post URL, media, caption, comments, metrics, and approval history.
3. **Assessment:** Determine root cause (policy miss, review miss, data/source issue, creative mismatch).
4. **Correction:** Publish corrected version only after re-approval through full checklist.
5. **Communication:** Issue internal incident note; external correction statement if required.
6. **Prevention:** Update prompts, filters, reviewer guidance, and training based on findings.

### Underperformance workflow
If a post underperforms below campaign thresholds:
- Run 24-hour and 72-hour diagnostics (hook, CTA, creative, timing, audience fit).
- Decide: iterate creative, repackage copy, retarget audience, or retire asset.
- Document experiment outcomes and feed improvements into future content briefs.

## Governance Ownership and Review Cadence
- **Owner:** Content Operations Lead.
- **Approvers:** Compliance Reviewer, Legal (as needed), Brand Lead.
- **Cadence:** Quarterly policy review, and ad-hoc updates after any SEV-1/SEV-2 incident or major platform policy change.

## Required Records
Retain for each published item:
- Brief and source references.
- Review checklist and named approvers.
- Asset rights evidence.
- Final caption/media payload.
- Incident and remediation notes (if any).
